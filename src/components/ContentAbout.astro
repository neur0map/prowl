        <p class="leading-relaxed">
            Prowl is an evolving suite of tools shaped by the predator–companion philosophy.
        </p>
        <ul class="space-y-2 text-sm leading-relaxed ml-4">
            <li><span class="text-amber-400 font-medium">•    Predators</span> are built for cybersecurity — sharp, offensive, and focused on the hunt.</li>
            <li><span class="text-blue-400 font-medium">•    Companions</span> are developer-oriented — supportive utilities that make work simpler and faster.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed">
            These projects began as personal experiments with AI coders, and continue to grow as I work toward a career in cybersecurity.

        <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed">
            Create tools that are <span class="text-amber-400">quick to start</span>, 
            <span class="text-blue-400">clear in purpose</span>, and 
            <span class="text-green-400">easy to trust</span>. Each release is designed 
            to do one thing well — no clutter, no bloat.

        <h3 class="text-lg font-medium text-white">Development Process</h3>
        <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed">
            What started as experiments for personal use grew into a hobby, and now I plan to put all tools I create under the umbrella of the Prowl name. The stack is kept lean (Rust for speed and reliability) and 
            development is guided by AI pair programming for fast iteration without sacrificing quality.
