        <p class="leading-relaxed">
            Prowl is the umbrella name for the small tools I create—focused utilities for my cybersecurity practice and developer workflows. I build them first for my own learning and use, and I share them in case they help others too.

        <h3 class="text-lg font-medium text-white">Who I am</h3>
        <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed">
            I'm a cybersecurity student, not a professional programmer. I know the basics of Rust and keep learning in my spare time. Most of the code for these projects is generated by AI pair programmers—my role is to define the idea, review the output, wire things together, and test until the tool does one job well.

        <h3 class="text-lg font-medium text-white">How the tools are built</h3>
        <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed">
            The philosophy is simple: <span class="text-amber-400">small</span>, 
            <span class="text-blue-400">clear</span>, 
            <span class="text-green-400">dependable</span>. I keep dependencies minimal, prefer fast start-up, and aim for readable configs over clever tricks. If something doesn't make the tool more useful in practice, it doesn't ship.

        <h3 class="text-lg font-medium text-white">Why I'm sharing them</h3>
        <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed">
            These tools were crafted for my own learning and day-to-day use while I practice cybersecurity. Publishing them makes the work accountable, invites feedback, and hopefully saves someone else time.

        <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed">
            This is a serious hobby, not a company. I maintain things as time allows and prioritize fixes that improve real use. Issues and PRs are welcome—community interest guides what evolves next.

        <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed">
            Security-oriented tools here are intended only for authorized, legal use—labs, coursework, OSCP-style practice, or engagements where you have explicit permission. Use them responsibly.

            If a tool helps you, stars, issues, and small contributions go a long way. Prowl will grow at the speed of learning—one focused, useful creature at a time.
